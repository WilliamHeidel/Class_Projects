# Class_Projects
A selected collection of projects from my various Masters' Classes and Data Science Certification Programs.

## Projects

### Data Visualization
1. Data Wrangling and Clustering Analysis of EV Charging Station Data.
    - Analysis and vizualization done in R.

### Deep Learning
1. Computer Vision - Object Detection
    - Trained an FCN for pixel-wise image classification using PyTorch in Google Colab.
2. Computer Vision - Video Game
    - Created a notebook to collect training data for PySuperTuxKart.
    - Trained a CNN for picture-wise image classification and an FCN for pixel-wise image classification on the collected training data using PyTorch in Google Colab.
    - Implemented an "agent" that would use the CNN to detect if the puck is in the image, then the FCN to detect the center of the puck, then steering logic based on the puck's location.

### ML Predictive Models Comparison
1. EDA and ML Classification Models Comparison (in Python)
    - Used EDA to explore and vizualize the dataset.
    - Build a classification model to predict if the customer is going to churn or not.
        1. Logistic Regression
        2. Decision Trees
        3. Random Forests
        4. BaggingClassifier
        5. Gradient Boost
        6. AdaBoost
        7. XGBoost
    - Optimized the model using appropriate techniques.
        1. Cross-Validation
        2. Hyperparameter Tuning
         - Grid Search
         - Randomized Search
    - Generated a set of insights and recommendations based off of the analysis.

### Natural Language Processing
1. Pre-Trained QA Model Analysis and Improvements
    - Done in python using PyTorch and Google Colab to train models.
    - Explored the performance and limitations of the pre-trained ELECTRA-small model on question answering (QA) tasks using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) as a benchmark.
    - Employed various ablation techniques and trained on adversarial datasets, including SQuAD Adversarial, Adversarial QA, and HotpotQA.

### Statistical Analysis
1.
